"""Vice City audio -> Ogg Vorbis, for the GameCube SD image.

    python3 convert_audio.py <GTAVC/audio dir> <output dir>

The .adf radio files are not a format: they are ordinary MPEG-1 Layer III with
every byte XOR'd by 0x22. Undo that and ffprobe reports mp3, 128kbps, 44.1kHz
stereo — verified on emotion.adf, whose first bytes become ff fb 90 6c, a valid
frame header.

Quality is matched to the SOURCE rather than maximised blindly. Re-encoding a
128kbps MP3 at 256kbps Vorbis recovers nothing the MP3 encoder already threw
away; it only doubles the file, and the whole set has to fit a 1.5GB disc.
Vorbis at the same nominal bitrate is already perceptually ahead of MP3 at that
bitrate, so quality 4 is transparent against its own source.

Everything here comes out 32kHz stereo, including the loose 64kbps 22kHz mono
files. Not for fidelity — upsampling adds none — but because sampman_gamecube
opens every stream voice VOICE_STEREO16 at DIGITALRATE (32000) and Tremor does
no conversion, so a mono or 44.1kHz file plays at the wrong pitch.

sfx.raw is untouched, and must stay that way: the sfx voices call
AESND_SetVoiceFrequency per sample from sfx.sdt, so they already play at their
own rate. Resampling that bank to 32kHz stereo would be 1.7GB, five times its
340MB, and would not fit the disc.

ffmpeg here decodes but does not encode Vorbis (this build ships only the
native encoder, which is experimental and worse than libvorbis), so sox does
the encoding. Both are checked for up front rather than failing halfway through
a 500MB job.
